Ideas:
------
- Musicbrainz!
- type member in GlyMemcache 
  - mostly implemented
  - COVER_BACK, COVER_FRONT.. etc. still missing

- new plugins (wikipedia for ainfo - clementine)
- at least two more review plugins
- colors for Win32
- check header for content type..

Missing:
--------
- ainfo with correct formatting, perhaps also review
- More documentation!
- short help (in work)
- making plugins that share code (clean up the mess..)
- Ensure legality (and add a legal note somewhere)
- Check if min/max works correct
- remove books (seperatze branch)
- example.c
- photos:google
