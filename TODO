Ideas:
------
- Musicbrainz!

Has
- labels x
- artists 
- releases
- tracks!

Could:
- tracklist
- albumlist
- review pages.. (at least the links.)


- get_type_to_string()
- type member in GlyMemcache 
  - mostly implemented
  - COVER_BACK, COVER_FRONT.. etc. still missing

- new plugins (wikipedia for ainfo - clementine)
- at least two more review plugins
- relation getter
- photo:discogs
- ainfo:discogs

Missing:
--------
- ainfo with correct formatting, perhaps also review
- More documentation!
- making plugins that share code (clean up the mess..)
- Ensure legality (and add a legal note somewhere)
- example.c
- photos:google
- content check via Header content type
