glyr is a (commandline) tool tow download lyrics and covers from the web
In future versions it will be able to downlaod also other meta-info,
but lyric/cover download works already very well:

Sources:

lyrics:
- lyricswiki
- lyrix.at
- darklyrics 
- lyrdb (lyrdb.com si currently borken and therfore disabled)
- magistrix (often gets wrong resutls and therfore disabled)
- metrolyrics

cover
- amazon (via freeapisign)
- discogs  
- last.fm
- lyricswiki 
- google as a fallback (finds ALWAYS some THING)

Goal:

* Providing a easy to use C-API to download various sort of metadata
* Always have more than fallback
* commandline intercace for annoyed linux users

Currently it has only a very limited commandline interface, look at main.c to see how it works
Examples:

./glyr lyric "Eluveitie" "Slania" "Slanias Song" "./" # downloads "Slanias Song" from Eluveitie into the dir "./", album is optional
./glyr cover "Eluveitie" "Everything remains as it never was" 10 "wldag"  # ...
