<h1>_Glyr_ is a searcheninge for musicrelated metadata</h1>

It comes both in a commandline interface tool and as a C library, both with an easy to use interface.
The sort of metadata glyr is searching (and downloading) is usually the data you see in your musicplayer.
And indeed, originally it was written to serve as internally library for a musicplayer, but has been extended to 
work as a standalone program which is able to download:
* cover art
* lyrics
* bandphotos
* artist biography
* album reviews 
* tracklists of an album
* and a list of albums from a specific artist.

*Terminology*:
To prevent disambiguation the following terms are used below: 	
* _glyrc_ is the commandline interface to libglyr.
* _libglyr_ is the library behind, which may be used by your program.
* a _getter_ is a type of metadata to download, e.g. cover
* a _provider_ is a source libglyr queries in order to find the data.
* a __group__ is a collection of __provider__ with similiar attributes (e.g. "__fast__")

<h2>FEATURES</h2>
* Always having more than fallback, and a hit rate of approx. 97% for coverdownload
* Portable: Windows and Linux are supported (Developement on Linux) see [1] for Mac OSX, 
* Fuzzy matching: Search providers with Levenshtein algorithm to eliminate typos and enhance search results.
* Fast Download: libcurl is used internally, and sources are searched in parallel, unneeded data is not downloaded if possible.
* Almost no dependencies: Just libcurl which is widely available.
* Download of a user defined amount of items, glyrc cover -a Foo -b Bar -n 30 loads 30 covers of 'Bar' by 'Foo'
* grouped download: Query providers by descending Accuray / Speed
* Optional download of images, URL is returned otherwise
* Prefers trustable sources (last.fm)
* Check for duplicate URLs, empty images and links known to be bad.
* Licensed under the GPLv3

<h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>

<h3>libglyr</h3>
See the "API Reference":https://github.com/sahib/glyr/wiki/API

<h3>glyrc:</h3>
glyrc GETTER [OPTIONS...]
Please refer to @glyrc --usage@ which is more up-to-date.

<h2>AUTHOR</h2>
See the AUTHORS file that comes in glyr's distribution.
See also COPYING to know about your rights.

<h2>BUGS</h2>
Libglyr is no finished software, as I write it in my free time and the same version may work the one day, but not the other, as Online APIs are changing.
(This is why I found fallbacks so important...)
So: EXPECT BUGS and Report them to sahib@online.de
or use the bugtracker at https://github.com/sahib/glyr/issues

Thanks for any patches / feedback in advance!
     

[1] Glyr has not been tested on Mac OSX yet. If you own such an Apple device any help with 'porting' glyr is highly appreciated. My guess would be that no to almost no changes have to be done.
